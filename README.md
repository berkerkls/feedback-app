## Feedback-App
***This is a project for React practice. You can check my commit how I practiced and what I learnt also.***

### Qualities
***You can choose a rating from radio buttons and you write your feedback to the input and you can submit. With button on each feedback, you can edit and delete the feedbacks.***

#### How I practice the Hooks
- In this project I learnt the usage of useState, useContext and useEffects. Also practiced usage of React Router.
- I used useState to take my state and use as the data.
- I used useEffect to render the page again when there is a change in my editFeedback state. 
- I use creatContext and useContext to not write the props and function in every line, in this way my code looks neater and easy to read.
